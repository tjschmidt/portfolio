                            I have a passion for software development and learning new technologies, and I have been
                            fortunate to have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects professionally. Here are some
                            of the projects that I've most enjoyed working on.

                                        Shortly after starting my professional career, I took over as the primary developer
                                        on a legacy C++ codebase designed for the modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) of
                                        radar. After some time working to improve the C++ codebase, I was designated as the
                                        technical lead for an effort to translate the core functionality of the M&amp;S
                                        software into MATLAB, an environment that the radar engineers were much more
                                        comfortable working in.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The team that I led was ultimately able to translate approximately 200k lines of
                                        code into object-oriented MATLAB. The new version of the software was welcomed by
                                        the end-users, and is under continued development to add additional features.

                                    <p>
                                        In addition to the MATLAB port, I independently replaced an outdated MATLAB-based
                                        GUI with a modern Java-based GUI to aid the end-users in the configuration of
                                        simulations.

                            </div>

                            <div class="flex spread padded nowrap-large">

                                        Our engineering team was asked to design and develop an Android
                                        application for remote data capture, as well as a web application for the analysis
                                        of the captured data. I was designated the to be technical lead and primary
                                        developer, and we were able to deliver and install a functional product
                                        only two months after accepting the contract. The highly-accelerated schedule
                                        was the result of a looming deadline on the customer's end, and we were relieved to
                                        provide them the opportunity to meet that deadline.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Our team lacked any Android experience, so I took it upon myself to learn what was
                                        necessary and act as a resource for the other members of the team. This ended up
                                        being an invaluable experience for me, and I am very happy to have gained a new
                                        skill.

                                        After supporting the development and maintenance of a legacy PHP codebase, our team
                                        was given the opportunity to create two new web-based applications for the entry and
                                        analysis of biological data.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I was tasked with doing a technology survey to determine whether we should stick
                                        with our legacy software stack (PHP-based), or switch to a more modern language.
                                        Given that most of our team was already familiar with Python (and my strong liking
                                        of the language), I ultimately settled on Python and Django, a feature-rich
                                        python-based web framework.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After a couple passes through the documentation and the creation of a toy project, I
                                        was able to bootstrap both pieces of software and teach the rest of the team the
                                        basics of Django, as well as provide continued support as development continued.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I have acted as the primary developer on one of the pieces of software, which has
                                        grown to have complex analysis capabilities through an intuitive user interface.
                                        A typical day's work ranges from troubleshooting Apache configuration issues to
                                        algorithm development to tweaking CSS, and I very much enjoy the variety that it
                                        provides.

                                        delve into it deeply enough to gain a proper understanding. I've recently decided to
                                        change that, and so I'm working on a lightweight, open-source wrapper around OpenGL
                                        that I've named Simple Graphics Layer (SGL).

                                        After a family member passed away, I wanted to make a gift for the immediate family,
                                        and ultimately decided on creating a portrait out of
                                        <a href="http://www.perler.com/">Perler beads</a>. Given that I'm not the
                                        most artistically-inclined person, I wrote some software to turn a photo into a
                                        large paint-by-number grid that I was able to print out.

                                        The portrait turned out better than I ever expected, and so I've decided to provide
                                        the tools I created to the rest of the bead-art community. You can check out the

                                        I own a large collection of DVDs, which I have converted into a digital library
                                        that lives on an external hard drive. While being able to watch the content
                                        on a computer was nice, I had the desire to be able to watch it on the TV with
                                        as little hassle as possible.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To accomplish this, I wrote a simple, clean web interface that allows me to browse
                                        my available movies, along with their cover art, descriptions, and various other
                                        pieces of metadata. The application is hosted on an inexpensive Raspberry Pi, which
                                        is then connected to the TV via HDMI.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        With this setup, I am able to play any movie in my collection using my phone,
                                        tablet, computer, or other internet-connected device as a remote control. This has
                                        vastly improved my satisfaction with my digital library, and is always a hit with
                                        overnight guests.
                                    </p>

                                        I've recently started playing a game called
                                        <a href="https://factorio.com/">Factorio</a>, in which you design a factory with the
                                        end-goal of launching a rocket into space. The game allows you to create blueprints,
                                        which allows for the rapid expansion of modular pieces of your factory.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There is currently no official way to create these blueprints outside of the game,
                                        and many people within the community have expressed interest in just that. As a
                                        result, I thought it would be a fun project to create a single-page web
                                        application that allows for the creation of arbitrary blueprints.

                                        You can follow my progress on that front through the

                                    When I'm not writing software, I spend as much time as possible with my lovely wife
                                    and our three furry children. I am an avid disc golfer, and enjoy being outdoors in
                                    pretty much any capacity, whether it be hiking, camping, or enjoying some of San
                                    Diego's restaurants. I am also (slowly) teaching myself to play the violin, and hope
                                    to one day be able to play well enough so as not to embarrass myself.
