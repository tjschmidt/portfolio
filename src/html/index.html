                    <p>
                        I have a passion for software development and learning new technologies, and I have been
                        fortunate to have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects professionally. Here are some
                        of the projects that I've most enjoyed working on.

                                    Shortly after starting my professional career, I took over as the primary developer
                                    on a legacy C++ codebase designed for the modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) of
                                    radar. After some time working to improve the C++ codebase, I was designated as the
                                    technical lead for an effort to translate the core functionality of the M&amp;S
                                    software into MATLAB, an environment that the radar engineers were much more
                                    comfortable working in.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The team that I led was ultimately able to translate approximately 200k lines of
                                    code into object-oriented MATLAB. The new version of the software was welcomed by
                                    the end-users, and is under continued development to add additional features.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to the MATLAB port, I independently replaced an outdated MATLAB-based
                                    GUI with a modern Java-based GUI to aid the end-users in the configuration of
                                    simulations.

                                    In December 2016, our engineering team was asked to design and develop an Android
                                    application for remote data capture, as well as a web application for the analysis
                                    of the captured data. I was designated the to be technical lead and primary
                                    developer, and we were able to deliver and install a functional product on March 1,
                                    2017, only two months after accepting the contract. The highly-accelerated schedule
                                    was the result of a looming deadline on the customer's end, and we were relieved to
                                    provide them the opportunity to meet that deadline.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our team lacked any Android experience, so I took it upon myself to learn what was
                                    necessary and act as a resource for the other members of the team. This ended up
                                    being an invaluable experience for me, and I am very happy to have gained a new
                                    skill.

                                    After supporting the development and maintenance of a legacy PHP codebase, our team
                                    was given the opportunity to create two new web-based applications for the entry and
                                    analysis of biological data.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I was tasked with doing a technology survey to determine whether we should stick
                                    with our legacy software stack (PHP-based), or switch to a more modern language.
                                    Given that most of our team was already familiar with Python (and my strong liking
                                    of the language), I ultimately settled on Python and Django, a feature-rich
                                    python-based web framework.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After a couple passes through the documentation and the creation of a toy project, I
                                    was able to bootstrap both pieces of software and teach the rest of the team the
                                    basics of Django, as well as provide continued support as development continued.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have acted as the primary developer on one of the pieces of software, which has
                                    grown to have complex analysis capabilities through an intuitive user interface.
                                    A typical day's work ranges from troubleshooting Apache configuration issues to
                                    algorithm development to tweaking CSS, and I very much enjoy the variety that it
                                    provides.

                                    I've always had an interest in graphics programming, but never found the time to
                                    delve into it deep enough to gain a proper understanding. I've recently decided to
                                    change that, and so I'm working on a lightweight, open source wrapper around OpenGL
                                    that I've named Simple Graphics Layer (SGL).

                                    After a family member passed away, I wanted to make a gift for the immediate family,
                                    and ultimately decided on creating a portrait out of
                                    <a href="http://www.perler.com/">Perler beads</a>. Given that I'm not the
                                    most artistically-inclined person, I wrote some software to turn a photo into a
                                    large paint-by-number grid that I was able to print out.

                                    The portrait turned out better than I ever expected, and so I've decided to provide
                                    the tools I created to the rest of the bead-art community. It's currently a
                                    work-in-progress, but check back soon for updates.

                                    I've recently started playing a game called
                                    <a href="https://factorio.com/">Factorio</a>, in which you design a factory with the
                                    end-goal of launching a rocket into space. The game allows you to create blueprints,
                                    which allows for the rapid expansion of modular pieces of your factory.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is currently no official way to create these blueprints outside of the game,
                                    and many people within the community have expressed interest in just that. As a
                                    result, I thought it would be a fun project to create a single-page web
                                    application that allows for the creation of arbitrary blueprints.

                                When I'm not writing software, I spend as much time as possible with my lovely wife
                                and our three furry children. I am an avid disc golfer, and enjoy being outdoors in
                                pretty much any capacity, whether it be hiking, camping, or enjoying some of San
                                Diego's restaurants. I am also (slowly) teaching myself to play the violin, and hope
                                to one day be able to play well enough so as not to embarrass myself.
